Algorithms Project: Sorting Analysis & Restricted Tower of Hanoi

This project contains two main parts:

1. Sorting Algorithms Comparison
2. Restricted Tower of Hanoi (Recursive Algorithm)

Both tasks are implemented in C++, focusing on analyzing algorithm efficiency and recursive problem solving.

Task (1): Sorting Algorithms Comparison

Description:
This task compares the performance of three basic sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

Each algorithm is implemented in a function that returns the number of comparisons performed while sorting an array.


Task (2): Restricted Tower of Hanoi:

Problem Description:
This task implements a restricted version of the classical Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.

In this version:
- You have 3 pegs: A, B, and C.
- You must move all disks from peg A to peg C.
- Every move must involve peg B meaning:
  - You can only place a disk on peg B, or
  - Move a disk from peg B.
- The usual rule still applies:
  - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one**.

This restriction changes the classic solution, requiring more moves and a slightly different recursive approach.
