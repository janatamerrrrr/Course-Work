Algorithms Project: Sorting Analysis & Restricted Tower of Hanoi

This project contains two main parts:

1. Sorting Algorithms Comparison
2. Restricted Tower of Hanoi (Recursive Algorithm)

Both tasks are implemented in C++, focusing on analyzing algorithm efficiency and recursive problem solving.

Task (1): Sorting Algorithms Comparison

Description:
This task compares the performance of three basic sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

Each algorithm is implemented in a function that returns the number of comparisons performed while sorting an array.


Task (2): Restricted Tower of Hanoi:

Problem Description:
This task implements a restricted version of the classical Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.

In this version:
- You have 3 pegs: A, B, and C.
- You must move all disks from peg A to peg C.
- Every move must involve peg B meaning:
  - You can only place a disk on peg B, or
  - Move a disk from peg B.
- The usual rule still applies:
  - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one**.

This restriction changes the classic solution, requiring more moves and a slightly different recursive approach.

Task (4): Anagroms checker:
This C++ program checks if two words are anagrams. It sorts the letters of each word using bubble sort and then compares them. If the sorted words are the same, they are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.
